# TSQL-Gold-Parser
TSQL stored procedure to load Gold-Parser compiled grammar, analyze sources and store symbols into persisting table.

See http://www.goldparser.org/ .

The goal of this personal project was to develop a Rule Engine to transpile into a mix of TSQL code and VB/C# code.

**Since the working conditions have changed, the project has been abandoned and I decided to open source it.**

Another project in which I would hope:

- develop a parser utility that records the symbol table in a SQLite database
- use the SQLite database as a central system for sharing development
- develop a text editor that exploits the previous library for sisntattica coloring and semantic analysis in a configurable way
- choose a common (typed) programming language as the basis for a trans-piling system
